Kinase Enrichment Analysis

[![](https://jitpack.io/v/MaayanLab/KEA.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#MaayanLab/KEA)

A web-based tool with an underlying database providing users with the ability to link lists of mammalian proteins/genes with the kinases that phosphorylate them. The system draws from several available kinase-substrate databases to compute kinase enrichment probability based on the distribution of kinase-substrate proportions in the background kinase-substrate database compared with kinases found to be associated with an input list of genes/proteins.
